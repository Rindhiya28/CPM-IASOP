# CPM-IASOP
Overview
IASOP & CPM is an innovative solution designed to revolutionize drug distribution and accessibility. The project consists of two main components: the IASOP app and the Compact Pharmaceutical Machine (CPM). The IASOP app connects users to these machines, ensuring efficient drug distribution and access to medications in both urban and rural areas. The CPM is an automated medicine dispensing machine that works in conjunction with the IASOP app.

Note: The current code repository contains only the user interface developed using Flutter. The main features, including hardware integration, prescription recognition, and outbreak prediction, are still in development.

Project Components
1. IASOP App
A mobile application that connects users to CPMs, allowing them to find nearby pharmacies, check medicine availability, and receive notifications about stock levels and expiry dates.

Note: The current version of the IASOP app includes only the user interface developed using Flutter. The core functionalities and backend integrations are under development.

2. Compact Pharmaceutical Machine (CPM)
A hardware component designed to dispense medicines efficiently and accurately. It aims to replace traditional pharmacies and improve the supply chain.

Note: The CPM hardware is currently under development, and updates will be provided as progress is made.

3. Kore.ai Chatbot
While the chatbot is not yet integrated into the app, you can interact with it directly via this link https://bots.kore.ai/webclient/c3b886c920d74581bb371890c8148ebba99fa6ad4bfe4290bc6e54883fd772dbst32 . The chatbot is designed to assist with prescription inquiries, refills, and more.

Technology Stack
Frontend: Flutter
Backend: Firebase (to be integrated)
AI and Chatbot: Kore.ai (to be integrated)
Machine Learning: TensorFlow Lite (for future prescription recognition and outbreak prediction)
Hardware: Compact Pharmaceutical Machine (CPM) (under development)
Outbreak Prediction ML Model
The Outbreak Prediction ML Model is an upcoming feature aimed at predicting potential disease outbreaks based on data analysis. The model uses machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns and trends in medical data, helping healthcare providers anticipate and respond to potential outbreaks more effectively.

Current Status: The model is in the development phase, and we are working on integrating it with the IASOP app. Once implemented, this feature will provide valuable insights into potential health risks, enabling proactive measures and efficient resource allocation.
